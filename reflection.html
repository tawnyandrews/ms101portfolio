        <h4>ABOUT THE COURSE</h4>
        <p>MS 101: Multi-Media Storytelling is a class offered at the University of San Francisco. I took this class with Professor Natacha Ruck in Fall 2020, and all pieces shown were created during this semester between August to December 2020.</p>      

        <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
        <p>This semester I was able to put together various works and projects as part of the MS 101 Multi-Media Storytelling class. These culminating projects include an audio story, a collection of photographs relating to a theme, and a video project. Throughout the duration of the course, I was able to find my voice as a storyteller, specifically through introspection and focusing my projects on personal experiences of mine. Prior to taking this class, I hadn’t had much experience with audio editing, took photos without much calculated thought, and dabbled with video editing for a few personal projects and contests. The software and applications I was most familiar with were iMovie, VSCO, and a bit of Davinci Resolve.</p>      
        <p>One of the first things we did in class was candidly brainstorm things we are/things we are not, and talk about an object of importance to us. These brainstorming sessions were incredibly helpful as it was the first time I put pieces of my own story on paper, which led me into beginning to visualize how I could take these feelings, moments, and experiences further into an artistic piece. Some topics I was able to explore further include working while in college (and during a pandemic); the complexities of having an intersectional identity, in terms of being biracial, the historic lack of diversity in tech (as a computer science major myself), imposter syndrome, etc. 
          </p>
        <p>With the 100 photograph assignment, I thought it was really interesting to take photos with intention, and have a specific style, method, or theme in mind as I took the photos. There were many photography techniques that I actually hadn’t heard of prior to discussing it in class, such as the rule of thirds. I always like taking scenery photos and appreciating the architecture in San Francisco, so this was a technique I tried to explore in some of my photos. In the photo section of my portfolio site, I decided to showcase my love of San Francisco and the unique look (and style) of the buildings even further. The title of my photo collection is “The Architecture of San Francisco”, and in this collection, I wanted my images to all be shots from my “point of view”, displaying on the screen what I see every time I look up and appreciate the beauty of the scenery around me. This exercise was super fun for me, and I really enjoyed stepping outside with my iPhone to capture some beautiful moments and scenes around me. I was definitely reminded of the old phrase “a picture speaks a thousand words” while I was editing and selecting my photos, as looking at the moments I captured really evoked great emotion in me. I feel really inspired to continue to take photos both with intention and without, and really explore the stories I can tell without words or motion. 
          </p>
        <p>The final video project was one of my favorite projects to work on this semester. The endless possibilities of what I could tell the story of and how I could tell the story were of course overwhelming initially, but it was really enjoyable getting to experiment with different things. After brainstorming various ideas and beginning to get experimental B-roll footage, I knew that I wanted to tell the story rooted in my experience of identifying with various different groups but never truly feeling to be a part of them.</p>
